# Welcome to the River Corridors SFA GitHub Organization
This GitHub Organization contains repositories associated with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) River Corridor Hydrobiogeochemistry Scientific Focus Area (RC SFA). PNNL's RC SFA works to transform understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics in river corridor hydrobiogeochemical functions from molecular reaction to watershed and basin scales. The knowledge we gain is used to improve mechanistic representation of river corridor processes, and their response to disturbances, in multiscale models of integrated hydrobiogeochemical function.

## :mag_right: How to find a repository
We are using GitHub Topics to organize our repos and allow them to be searchable. You can choose to search within a repository, within an organization, or across all of GitHub. The more specific you make your Topic, the more restrictive the search will be. For example, if we use "sss" instead of "rcsfa-sss", many extraneous repositories will show up in the search across all of GitHub if we were searching outside the SFA GitHub Organization. Use the following vocabulary to aid your search: 
- Project Element: `rcsfa-rc1`, `rcsfa-rc2`, `rcsfa-rc3`, `rcsfa-rc4`, `rcsfa-mm`, `rcsfa-fy24renewal`
- Project Type: `rcsfa-manuscript`, `rcsfa-resource`
- Calendar Year: `rcsfa-YYYY` (e.g., "rcsfa-2023")
- Author: `lastname-firstname` (e.g., "smith-john")
- Any additional keyword (e.g., "machine-learning", "modeling", "river", "rcsfa-sss", etc.)

There are multiple ways to use Topics as a search tool.
1. If you're in a repo that has a Topic of interest, click on the Topic. If any public repositories exist, they will appear here. Any private repositories you have access to will also appear. Otherwise, private repositories will not appear in your search. Note that this search method restricts your search to the organization you are searching within.
2. Use the main search bar to look for your Topic. After running the search, you will initially see all the public repositories that include your search criteria (whether as a Topic or elsewhere in the repo) across all of GitHub. Use the "Filter by" section on the left side to further restrict your search criteria.
